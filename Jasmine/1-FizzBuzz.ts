// FizzBuzz

// This is a timed exercise: the faster you get to a working solution, the better.
// Performance, Maintainability, Duplication, Code Smells, ... it is all irrelevant.
// Only the amount of time needed to come to a complete solution matters.

// Loop from 1 to 100 (including 100) and do a console.log for each number, except
// When it is a multiple of 3 print Fizz
// When it is a multiple of 5 print Buzz
// When it is a multiple of 3 and 5 print FizzBuzz
// Example output: 1, 2, Fizz, 4, Buzz, Fizz, 7, 8, Fizz, Buzz, 11, Fizz, 13, 14, FizzBuzz, 16

  console.log('1');
